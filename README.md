# iVoice Callback Service - Background Information.

Prioritise your customers with real-time voice assistance at any time of the day (or night). If a customer needs advice or guidance then iVoice Callback acts as an intermediary between them and you. By placing a simple iVoice Callback Call-To-Action on your website, the customer can simply click it, add their telephone number and iVoice Callback will immediately connect them to a company representative. No holding, no voice-mail, no navigating through telephone menus.

Maybe they need further details on a product, perhaps they have concerns about online payments, or they’re just not sure how to complete the checkout process. Whatever their worries or concerns are, the customer can easily get in touch with you by simply clicking on the iVoice Callback link.

Customers can choose an immediate or a scheduled call back, allowing you the opportunity to provide the necessary assistance at their convenience. This is so much easier for the customer than merely providing a phone number for them to call. A frustrated or nervous customer won’t want to go to the expense and effort of placing a phone call through to your customer service department, especially if they then find it unmanned or are left waiting in a queue that they will probably just abandon
